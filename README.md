# TiBox2d
A Taichi Hackthon project  
Yet another game-oriented GPU Physics Engine

## Motivation: 
1. Fulfill a wish from 2 years ago when I first learned Taichi and GAMES201
2. Most developers who want to write a physics simulation game with Taichi can't help but use "MPM99" as a template and modify it, so it's time to bring some diversity.
3. for fun

## Goal
One or several game demo based on this project

## Todo List (Priority from highest to lowest):
- [x] rigid Body  
- [x] elastic & plastic bodies  
- [x] Neighborhood Search for collision handling
- [ ] ropes  
- [x] fluid  
- [ ] cloth
